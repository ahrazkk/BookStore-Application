# BookStore-Application
Project: Book Store Management Application

Implemented a comprehensive Book Store Management application using JavaFX, incorporating advanced features and applying complex design patterns. The project aimed to provide a user-friendly interface for bookstore owners to manage their inventory effectively. Additionally, VisualParadigm was utilized to create UML case and class diagrams, enhancing the understanding and organization of the codebase.

One notable use-case within the application involved the "AddBook" functionality, initiated by the owner. This use-case allowed the owner to seamlessly add new books to the system through a visually appealing Edit Books window. The application facilitated the entry of book information, including name and price, while ensuring prompt updates in the table displaying the current books. Furthermore, exception handling was implemented to validate numeric input for book prices.

The project also incorporated the State Design Pattern to manage the dynamic status of customers within the bookstore. Customers were categorized as either Gold or Silver based on the points they earned from book purchases. The system automatically adjusted their status when reaching certain thresholds, such as transitioning from Silver to Gold upon accumulating over 1000 points. This design pattern provided flexibility for future expansion, allowing the easy integration of additional statuses like Bronze.

By combining sophisticated JavaFX implementation, utilization of VisualParadigm for comprehensive UML diagrams, and application of the adaptable State Design Pattern, the Book Store Management project demonstrated an advanced level of software development and design skills.
